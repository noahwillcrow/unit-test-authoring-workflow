# Task
Your task is to generate unit tests for a C# class. Keep the following priorities in mind:
- Tests should be succinct and easy to read their purpose
- Tests should enumerate all possible code paths for maximum code coverage

Tests should be written to match the trend shown in the given example. Use the given example to determine naming conventions for variables, the templating structure, and the order of the elements. If the example uses PascalCase, so should you, and same for camelCase or snake_case. Additionally, if the example has elements in a section ordered alphabetically, so should you.

## Example
```csharp
{{Example}}
```

## Class to Test
```csharp
{{ClassToTest}}
```

## Unit Testing File
And here is the current state of the unit testing file you are to populate:
```csharp
{{ExistingUnitTests}}
```

## Output Format
Please feel free to do any thinking you'd like, but once you're ready, put the code in between `<code></code>` tags and make sure the only thing in between those tags is valid C# code.
