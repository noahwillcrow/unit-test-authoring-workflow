## Example test file
The following is an example test file that has already been authored for another class. Your job is to emulate its style, including variable naming, mocks setup, and anything else that will help it to appear as if it was authored by the same writer.
```csharp
{{ExampleTestsFile}}
```

## Class to Test
Below is the class that you are to write tests for.
